I see peaks around 2005 and 2009, which indicates that there were significant increases in the number of movies added to the IMDb database during those years.
These peaks could be explained by:

* Actual increases in film production globally during those periods
* Changes in IMDb's data collection methods or coverage
* Increased digitization of film records from those periods
* Industry booms in film production that occurred during those years
* The rise of independent and digital filmmaking making it easier to produce and distribute films
